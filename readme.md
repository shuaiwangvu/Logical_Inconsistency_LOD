# Inconsistency in LOD-a-lot

Here you can find a simple script that prints some additional links in the LOD-a-lot file. These are not relations between entities in RDF, RDFS, and OWL but are not covered by the original design of RDF, RDFS, nor OWL.

You can find the Python script in the file
```analysis.py```.

Additionally, the output can be found in ```output.txt```.
